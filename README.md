# CheckiO.python

The repository contains some of my solutions to the CheckiO puzzles that were a little bit more difficult for me to solve.

More interesting are:
* Cheapest flight
* Ugly numbers
* Open labyrinth

The full list of my hundred solutions can be found on my [CheckiO profile](https://py.checkio.org/user/waffell/).
