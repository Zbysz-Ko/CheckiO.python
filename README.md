# CheckiO.python

The repository contains some of my solutions to the CheckiO puzzles.

More interesting are:
* Cheapest flight - The difficulty with recursion is the abstract way in which a function can call itself.
* Ugly numbers - Example of a task where taking the obvious path leads to a dead end (due to insufficient script performance). Compare solutions in two files: _ugly-numbers_very-slow.py_ and _ugly-numbers_more-effective.py_.
* Open labyrinth - Who doesn't like to play games?

The full list of my solutions can be found on my [CheckiO profile](https://py.checkio.org/user/waffell/).
